Pion Common Library: a collection of common libraries used by the Pion Platform

See COPYING for licensing information.

Build and installation summary:

# ./configure [--with-boost=<BOOST_DIR>]
# make all
# make check	(this will build and run Pion's unit tests)
# make install	(this may require superuser/Administrator privileges)

Note that you only need to specify a "--with-boost=<BOOST_DIR>" parameter to
Pion's configure script if you installed Boost into an alternative directory
(other than /usr/local).

Detailed build instructions are available for all of the platforms supported
by the Pion within the "common/doc" subdirectory (README.platform).  Please
read these instructions first.

Starting with 0.4.2, Pion REQUIRES the Boost C++ libraries (version 1.34.1
or greater), and the Boost ASIO library (version 0.3.9 or greater). Please see
the README.boost file within the "common/doc" subdirectory for instructions on
how to download, build and install these libraries.

Boost ASIO additionally requires OpenSSL for SSL/TLS support and zlib for
compression.  You can download these libraries from the following locations:

http://www.openssl.org
http://www.zlib.net

For logging, Pion may be configured to:

a) use std::cout and std::cerr for logging (the default configuration)
b) use one of the following open source libraries: log4cxx, log4cpp or
   log4cplus (configure using one of --with-log4cxx, --with-log4cpp or
   --with-log4cplus, respectively)
c) disable logging entirely (configure --disable-logging)

You can download these logging libraries from the following locations:

http://logging.apache.org/log4cxx
http://log4cpp.sourceforge.net
http://log4cplus.sourceforge.net

Please note that not all of these libraries work on all platforms.  Please
see the README.platform files for more information.
