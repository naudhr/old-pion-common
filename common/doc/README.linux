Linux Build Instructions
========================

The Easy Way:
-------------

Atomic Labs has a tarball available from the "Third Party Libraries" page
on our website that contains all of the required libraries to build Pion
for certain versions of Redhat Linux.  To get started quickly, just download
and uncompress this file into your /usr/local/ directory, and you should be
able to skip down to the last step!


Building Boost with ASIO:
-------------------------

Please see the README.boost file for instructions.

If you have an older version of Boost (pre-1.35) already installed, you will
likely will need to first uninstall it so that gcc and libtool do not get
confused:

# rpm -e boost boost-devel

If you're using RHEL/CentOS 4 (or earlier), please note that Boost 1.37.0 does
not seem to work with gcc 3.x.  You should use gcc4 instead:

# yum install gcc4 gcc4-c++

Before running "make" to build the Boost libraries, edit the user-config.jam
file and change this:

using gcc ;

to this:

using gcc : : g++4 ;


Installing zlib, bzlib & openssl:
---------------------------------

Pion requires zlib, bzlib and openssl for compression and SSL/TLS encryption
support, respectively.  These libraries are normally pre-installed on 
Linux. If you do not have them already, you should be able to use your 
favorite package manager (yum, up2date or aptget) to install the latest 
versions:

# yum install openssl openssl-devel zlib zlib-devel bzip2 bzip2-devel bzip2-libs
# up2date openssl openssl-devel zlib zlib-devel bzip2 bzip2-devel bzip2-libs
# apt-get install openssl openssl-devel zlib zlib-devel bzip2 bzip2-devel bzip2-libs


Installing log4cxx:
-------------------

Note that the use of a logging framework is entirely optional, so you may
skip this step if you like.

We recommend that you use log4cxx for logging.  Log4cxx 0.10.0 and later
requires that you have the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) installed.  This
library is normally pre-installed on Linux.  If you do not have it already,
you should be able to grab the latest version using your favorite package 
manager:

# yum install apr apr-devel apr-util apr-util-devel
# up2date apr apr-devel apr-util apr-util-devel
# apt-get install apr apr-devel apr-util apr-util-devel

For Redhat Enterprise and CentOS releases earlier than version 5, you will
need to download and build the APR libraries from source since the available
RPMs are incompatible with log4cxx.  You can download the latest source code
tarballs from the "Third Party Libraries" page on our website, or from the
following site:

http://apr.apache.org

You will need to install both the "apr" and the "apr-util" packages.  For
each, just download the source and run:

# bzip2 -dc apr-<version>.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -
# cd apr-<version>
# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-threads --with-apr=/usr/local
# make all
# make install

After installing APR, please visit the "Third Party Libraries" page on 
our website to obtain a source code tarball.  Then, just run:

# tar xvfj log4cxx-<version>.tar.bz2
# cd log4cxx-<version>
# ./configure
# make all
# make install

The final linking stage of building log4cxx 0.10.0 fails for 64-bit 
versions of Redhat, apparently due to errors with the 64-bit libapr that 
it includes. If you encounter an error while performing the final link, 
try running the link_log4cxx.sh script included with Pion from your 
log4cxx source directory:

# <PION-ROOT>/common/build/link_log4cxx.sh

If this works, you can complete the log4cxx installation manually by using
the following commands:

# mv src/main/cpp/.libs/liblog4cxx.so.10.0.0 /usr/local/lib
# ln -s /usr/local/lib/liblog4cxx.so.10.0.0 /usr/local/lib/liblog4cxx.so.10
# ln -s /usr/local/lib/liblog4cxx.so.10.0.0 /usr/local/lib/liblog4cxx.so
# mv src/main/include/log4cxx /usr/local/include


Installing libxml2:
-------------------

The Pion Platform requires the libxml2 development library for 
manipulating configuration files, and other things.  This library is not 
used by the Pion Network Library, so you may skip this step if you are 
only building the Network Library.

The libxml2 library is normally pre-installed on Linux.  If you do not 
have it already, you should be able to grab the latest version using 
your favorite package manager:

# yum install libxml2 libxml2-devel
# up2date libxml2 libxml2-devel
# apt-get install libxml2 libxml2-devel


Installing OSSP uuid:
---------------------

The Pion Platform requires the OSSP uuid library to generate universally 
unique identifiers for most platforms, including Linux.  This library is 
not used by the Pion Network Library, so you may skip this step if you 
are only building the Network Library.

You can download the source code tarball for the uuid library from the 
"Third Party Libraries" page on our website.  After downloading it, just 
run:

# tar xvfz uuid-<version>.tar.gz
# cd uuid-<version>
# ./configure
# make all
# make install


Installing SQLite:
------------------

SQLite version 3 is required to build support for the embedded database
(the SQLiteDatabase plugin).  You may skip this step if you do not want
to build support for the embedded database.

SQLite is normally pre-installed on Linux.  If you do not  have it already,
you should be able to grab the latest version using your favorite package
manager:

# yum install sqlite sqlite-devel
# up2date sqlite sqlite-devel
# apt-get install sqlite sqlite-devel


Installing YAJL:
----------------

YAJL ("Yet Another JSON Library") is required to build support for the
JSONCodec plugin.  You may skip this step if you do not want to build
support for JSON.

To build YAJL, you must first have Ruby and CMake installed on your system. 
If you do not  have them already, you should be able to grab the latest
versions using your favorite package manager:

# yum install ruby cmake
# up2date ruby cmake
# apt-get install ruby cmake

You can download the source code tarball for YAJL from the "Third Party
Libraries" page on our website.  After downloading it, just run:

# tar xvfz yajl-<version>.tgz
# cd yajl-<version>
# ./configure
# make

To install YAJL, we recommend that you just move the build files in the
"build/yajl-<version>" subdirectory into /usr/local:

# sudo mv build/yajl-<version>/lib/* /usr/local/lib
# sudo mv build/yajl-<version>/include/yajl /usr/local/include


Building and installing Pion:
-----------------------------

Now you should be able to build and install Pion:

# tar xvfz pion-<PROJECT>-<VERSION>.tar.gz
# cd pion-<PROJECT>-<VERSION>
# ./configure [--with-openssl] [--with-log4cxx] [--with-sqlite] [--with-yajl]
# make all
# make install

To build and run Pion's unit tests, run "make check"

Note: if you're using RHEL/CentOS 4 with Boost 1.37.0 & gcc4, use:

# CC="gcc4" CXX="g++4" ./configure ...


Known Problems
--------------

The Pion executables may complain about loading shared libraries if the
Boost and/or other libraries are not in your search path.  Try this:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
